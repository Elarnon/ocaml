open Lambda

(** TRMC (tail-recursion-modulo-cons) is a code transformation that
    rewrites transformed functions in destination-passing-style, in
    such a way that certain calls that were not in tail position in the
    original program become tail-calls in the transformed program.

    As a classic example, the following program
    {|
     let rec map f = function
     | [] -> []
     | x :: xs ->
       let y = f x in
       y :: map f xs
    |}
    becomes (expressed in almost-source-form; the translation is in
    fact at the Lambda-level)
    {|
     let rec map f = function
     | [] -> []
     | x :: xs _>
       let y = f x in
       let dst = y :: Placeholder in
       map_trmc dst 1 f xs; dst
     and map_trmc dst offset f = function
     | [] ->
       dst.1 <- []
     | x :: xs ->
       let y = f x in
       let dst' = y :: Placeholder in
       dst.offset <- dst';
       map_trmc dst offset f fx
    |}

    In this example, the expression (y :: map f xs) had a call in
    non-tail-position, and it gets rewritten into tail-calls.  TRMC
    handles all such cases where the continuation of the call
    (what needs to be done after the return) is a "construction", the
    creation of a (possibly nested) data block.

    The code transformation generates two versions of the
    input function, the "direct" version with the same type and
    behavior as the original one (here just [map]), and
    the "destination-passing-style" version (here just [map_trmc]).

    Any call to the original function from outside the let..rec
    declaration gets transformed into a call into the direct version,
    which will itself call the destination-passing-style versions on
    recursive calls that may benefit from it (they are in tail-position
    modulo constructors).

    Because of this inherent code duplication, the transformation may
    not always improve performance. In this implementation, TRMC is
    opt-in, we only transform functions that the user has annotated
    with an attribute to request the transformation.

    Note: in this implementation, the scope of the TRMC transformation
    is a single set of mutually-recursive-declarations; TRMC applies
    to declarations of the form
      [let[@trmc] rec f1 = t1 and .. and fn = tn in u]
    and only the callsites of [f1..fn] within [t1..tn] will get
    considered for destination-passing-style transformations; callsites in [u]
    are not analyzed, and will always call the direct version (which may
    in turn call the destination-passing-style versions).
    In particular, there is no propagation of information across modules.

type 'offset destination = { var: Ident.t; offset: 'offset; }
and offset = lambda
(** In the OCaml value model, interior pointers are not allowed.  To
    represent the "placeholder to mutate" in DPS code, we thus use a pair
    of the block containing the placeholder, and the offset of the
    placeholder within the block.

    In the common case, this offset is an arbitrary lambda expression, typically
    a constant integer or a variable. We define ['a destination] as parametrized
    over the offset type to represent formal destination parameters (where
    the offset is an Ident.t), and maybe in the future statically-known
    offsets (where the offset is an integer).
*)

let add_dst_params ({var; offset} : Ident.t destination) params =
  (var, Pgenval) :: (offset, Pintval) :: params

let add_dst_args ({var; offset} : offset destination) args =
  Lvar var :: offset :: args

let assign_to_dst loc {var; offset} lam =
  Lprim(Psetfield_computed(Pointer, Heap_initialization),
        [Lvar var; offset; lam], loc)

(** The type ['a Dps.t] (destination-passing-style) represents a
    version of ['a] that is parametrized over a [lambda destination].
    A [lambda Dps.t] is a code fragment in destination-passing-style,
    a [(lambda * lambda) Dps.t] represents two subterms parametrized
    over the same destination. *)
module Dps = struct
  type 'a dynamic =
    tail:bool -> dst:lambda destination -> 'a
  (** A term parametrized over a destination. The [tail] argument is
      passed by the caller to indicate whether the term will be placed
      in tail-position -- this allows to generate correct @tailcall
      annotations. *)

  type 'a linear_static =
    tail:bool -> dst:lambda destination -> delayed:(lambda -> lambda) -> 'a
  (** Short verion:

      To optimize nested constructors, we keep track in the choice
      structure of which DPS terms are in the "linear static"
      fragment, where the destination is set in a single static
      location of the program (and not by calling another
      TRMC function).

      When we would generate code to update a destination by setting
      it to a "partial value" containing a new destination, we can
      look at whether the consumer of this new destination is in the
      linear static DPS fragment. In this case we optimize away the
      creation of the new location (and update to the
      current destination) by "delaying" the partial value application
      to the unique place inside the DPS term that sets its
      destination.

      The [delayed] argument of a static DPS term represents those
      delayed partial contexts, to be applied when setting the
      location.

      Longer version with examples:

      We want to optimize nested constructors, for example

      {[
        (x () :: y () :: trmc call)
      ]}

      which would naively generate (in a DPS context parametrized
      over a location dst.i):

      {[
        let dstx = x () :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- dstx;
        let dsty = y () :: Placeholder in
        dstx.1 <- dsty;
        trmc dsty.1 call
      ]}

      when we would rather hope for

      {[
        let vx = x () in
        let dsty = y () :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- vx :: dsty;
        trmc dsty.1 call
      ]}

      We could detect this special case (nested constructors)
      and generate the expected code. But can we instead see this as
      a specific instance of a more general/powerful optimization?

      The idea is that the unoptimized version is of the form
      of a destination-creation site for dstx.1

      {[
        let dstx = x () :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- dstx;
      ]}

      followed by a piece of code where the value set to [dstx.1] is
      statically known: there is a single place that writes to it, in the
      current function body. This destination is used in a linear static
      way, in opposition to:

      - non-linear usage: cases where the control-flow splits and
        multiple places write different things to dstx.1

      - dynamic usage: when the destination is passed to a function call
        rather than set explicitly in the body.

      When a choice uses its destination in a linear static way, we
      could optimize away the destination creation by it inside the
      linear-static choice, to get simplified away when it meets the
      single destination-set instruction. This transformation suffices
      to get from the "regular" to the "optimized" version of the
      instance above.

      So this is the idea: this simplification of nested constructors
      can be justified for the whole class of expressions that are doing
      a "linear static" usage of their continuations.

      We do this on the fly in our implementation. We avoid creating
      this new destination [dstx.1], and instead pass to the following
      code the destination [dst.i] with a "delayed" transformation
      [(x () ::)], to be applied at the place where [dstx.1] would
      have been set:

      {[
        dstx.1 <- dsty;
      ]}
      becomes
      {[
        dst.i <- x () :: dsty;
      ]}

      More precisely, we need to bind the possibly-effectful [x ()]
      to a variable [vx], so that it does not get reordered with
      respect to other computations in the term ([y ()] in our example above).

      Finally, we give some counter-examples where usage is non-linear.

      Source program:
      {[
        x :: (if foo then y1 :: trmc call1 else y2 :: trmc call2)
      ]}

      Naive code:
      {[
        let dstx = x :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- dstx;
        if foo then begin
          let dsty1 = y1 :: Placeholder in
          dstx.1 <- dsty1;
          trmc dsty1.1 call1
        end else
          let dsty2 = y2 :: Placeholder in
          dstx.1 <- dsty2;
          trmc dsty2.1 call1
        end
      ]}

      One could propose to optimize this into:
      {[
        let vx = x in
        if foo then begin
          let dsty1 = y1 :: Placeholder in
          dstx.1 <- vx :: sty1;
          trmc dsty1.1 call1
        end else
          let dsty2 = y2 :: Placeholder in
          dstx.1 <- vx :: dsty2;
          trmc dsty2.1 call1
        end
      ]}
      but note that this duplicates the (vx ::) construction in the two
      branches, while we want to avoid any code duplication in the code
      generated for a single specialization of the TRMC
      function. (In general this duplicated part corresponds to the
      nested constructors so it may be quite large, when constructing
      interesting AST fragments for example.)

      On the other hand, the following examples are outside the "nested
      constructor" fragment and yet remains static and linear, so we can
      optimize them:
      {[
        x :: (foo; y :: trmc call)
        x :: (let v = e in y :: trmc call)
      ]}
  *)

(** The TRMC transformation requires information flows in two opposite
    directions: the information of which callsites can be rewritten in
    destination-passing-style flows from the leaves of the code to the
    root, and the information on whether we remain in tail-position
    flows from the root to the leaves -- and also the knowledge of
    which version of the function we currently want to generate, the
    direct version or a destination-passing-style version.

    To clarify this double flow of information, we split the TRMC
    compilation in two steps:

    1. A function [trmc t] that takes a term and processes it from
    leaves to root; it produces a "code choice", a piece of data of
    type [lambda Choice.t], that contains information on how to transform the
    input term [t] *parameterized* over the (still missing) contextual
    information.

    2. Code-production operators that have contextual information
    to transform a "code choice" into the final code.

    The code-production choices for a single term have type [lambda Choice.t];
    using a parametrized type ['a Choice.t] is useful to represent simultaneous
    choices over several subterms; for example [(lambda * lambda) Choice.t]
    makes a choice for a pair of terms, for example the [then] and [else]
    cases of a conditional (their choice is synchronized, they are either
    both in destination-passing-style or none of them is). With this parameter,
    ['a Choice.t] has an applicative structure, which is useful to write
    the actual code transformation in the {!choice} function.

    | Set of 'a settable
    (** [Set t] represents a piece of code that does contain
        TRMC opportunities: if the context allows, we can write parts of

       code in [dps] -- a function parametrized over the destination.
       It passes the ~tail boolean to indicate whether the produced code
       is used in tail position.

     - If the surrounding context is in direct style (no destination
       is available), we should produce the fallback code from
       [direct].

      (Note: [direct] is also a function (on [unit]) to ensure that any
